## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Sequential Agent Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Agent 1 (Foundation - Start Immediately)
"I need you to work on Issue #239 - Core Operations Engine"

# Deploy Agent 2 (UI Tools - After Agent 1 is 70% complete)
"I need you to work on Issue #241 - Interactive UI Tools"

# Deploy Agent 3 (Visualization - After Agent 1 is 70% complete)
"I need you to work on Issue #243 - Reading Order Visualization"

# Deploy Agent 4 (Integration - After all agents are 80% complete)
"I need you to work on Issue #245 - Structure Wizard & Export System"
```
