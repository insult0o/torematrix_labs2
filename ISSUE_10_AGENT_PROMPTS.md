# ISSUE #10 - Metadata Extraction Engine: Agent Prompts

## ðŸŽ¯ Simple Copy-Paste Prompts for Each Agent

### ðŸ”§ AGENT 1: Core Metadata Engine

**Prompt to start Agent 1:**
```
I'm Agent 1 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_1_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #98 for official requirements

I need to implement:
- Core MetadataExtractionEngine with async processing
- Comprehensive metadata schema with validation
- Document and page-level extractors
- Confidence scoring framework
- Language/encoding detection
- Extensible extractor interface

Ready to start with foundational metadata extraction engine implementation.
```

### ðŸ”— AGENT 2: Relationship Detection & Graph Construction

**Prompt to start Agent 2:**
```
I'm Agent 2 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_2_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #100 for official requirements

I need to implement:
- Relationship detection algorithms with graph construction
- Reading order determination system
- Semantic role classification (ML + rules)
- Graph-based relationship storage
- Relationship validation framework
- Query interface for relationships

Depends on Agent 1 completion. Ready to start after Agent 1 delivers core metadata engine.
```

### âš¡ AGENT 3: Performance Optimization & Caching

**Prompt to start Agent 3:**
```
I'm Agent 3 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_3_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #102 for official requirements

I need to implement:
- Multi-level caching system (memory, disk, distributed)
- Parallel extraction worker pool
- Incremental metadata update capability
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Memory optimization for 10K+ elements
- Batch processing for multiple documents

Depends on Agent 1 & 2 foundations. Ready to optimize performance after core systems are built.
```

### ðŸš€ AGENT 4: Integration, Testing & Production

**Prompt to start Agent 4:**
```
I'm Agent 4 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_4_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #103 for official requirements

I need to implement:
- Complete system integration with existing pipeline
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, performance)
- Production monitoring and observability
- API endpoints and WebSocket support
- Deployment configuration and validation
- Error handling and graceful degradation

Depends on all other agents. Ready to integrate everything into production-ready system.
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference for All Agents

### Key Files to Read:
- `AGENT_X_METADATA.md` - Your specific assignment (replace X with your agent number)
- `METADATA_COORDINATION.md` - Coordination timeline and interfaces
- GitHub sub-issue #(98/100/102/103) - Official requirements for your component

### Development Timeline:
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-2)**: Agent 1 builds foundation
- **Phase 2 (Days 3-4)**: Agents 2 & 3 build specialized systems
- **Phase 3 (Days 5-6)**: Agent 4 integrates everything

### Success Metrics:
- >95% test coverage across all components
- >90% relationship detection accuracy (Agent 2)
- 10x+ performance improvement (Agent 3)
- Production deployment ready (Agent 4)

### Communication Protocol:
- Daily updates on GitHub sub-issues
- Coordinate integration points via METADATA_COORDINATION.md
- Use "end work" routine when completing your component
