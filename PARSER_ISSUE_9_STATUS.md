## ⚠️ Current Situation

All 4 sub-issues are marked as CLOSED, but:
1. Only Agent 1's work (my work) has been verified with actual implementation
2. Need to check if other agents' work exists in the repositories
3. Need integration tests to verify all components work together
4. Main issue #9 is still OPEN despite all sub-issues being closed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Verify implementation status for Agents 2, 3, and 4
2. Create integration tests if implementations exist
3. Update main issue #9 with complete status
4. Close main issue if all criteria are met
