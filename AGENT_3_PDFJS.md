# Agent 3: PDF.js Performance Optimization
**Issue #16.3 | Sub-Issue #126 | Days 3-4 | Critical Performance Enhancement**

## 🎯 Your Mission
You are **Agent 3**, responsible for optimizing PDF.js performance for large documents, implementing efficient memory management, and adding hardware acceleration support. Your work ensures the PDF viewer can handle production workloads with 100MB+ documents while maintaining responsive user experience.

## 📋 Your Specific Tasks

### Phase 1: Performance Analysis & Monitoring
- Set up comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure
- Create benchmarking suite for PDF operations (load, render, navigation)
- Profile memory usage patterns and identify bottlenecks
- Implement real-time performance metrics collection
- Create performance dashboard and alerting system

### Phase 2: Memory Management System
- Implement intelligent page caching with LRU algorithm
- Create memory pool for PDF resources and efficient allocation
- Add automatic garbage collection triggers based on memory pressure
- Implement memory leak detection and prevention
- Create configurable memory limits and thresholds

### Phase 3: Large PDF Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for PDF pages (only load visible + preload buffer)
- Create progressive rendering system for large documents
- Add viewport-based page loading and unloading
- Implement smart prefetching algorithms for documents >100MB
- Optimize rendering pipeline for performance

### Phase 4: Hardware Acceleration
- Enable GPU acceleration in QWebEngineView settings
- Configure PDF.js for hardware rendering when available
- Implement fallback strategies for systems without GPU support
- Add hardware capability detection and adaptive switching
- Optimize canvas rendering for GPU acceleration

## 🎯 Performance Targets
- **50% reduction** in memory usage for large PDFs
- **3x faster loading** for documents >50MB  
- **<5s load time** for 100MB PDFs
- **Hardware acceleration** on supported systems
- **Memory leaks eliminated** completely
- **<200MB total memory** usage for large documents

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Agent 1 (Core Viewer)
```python
# Interface provided by Agent 1
viewer.set_performance_config(performance_config)

# Your implementation
class PerformanceConfig:
    cache_size_mb: int = 200
    max_preload_pages: int = 5
    enable_gpu_acceleration: bool = True
    memory_pressure_threshold: float = 0.8
```

### With Agent 2 (Bridge)
```python
# Receive performance data from JavaScript
bridge.performance_event.connect(self.handle_performance_data)

# Send performance commands to JavaScript
bridge.send_feature_command("performance", "set_cache_size", {"size_mb": 200})
```

### With Agent 4 (Features)
```python
# Provide performance metrics for UI display
performance_monitor.metrics_updated.connect(ui_manager.update_performance_status)
```
