## 📱 Responsive Breakpoint System

### Default Breakpoints
```python
BREAKPOINTS = {
    'xs': {'max_width': 576, 'name': 'Extra Small'},
    'sm': {'max_width': 768, 'name': 'Small'},
    'md': {'max_width': 992, 'name': 'Medium'},
    'lg': {'max_width': 1200, 'name': 'Large'},
    'xl': {'max_width': 1400, 'name': 'Extra Large'},
    'xxl': {'min_width': 1401, 'name': 'Extra Extra Large'}
}
```

### Responsive Layout Rules
```python
# Layout adaptation based on screen size
responsive_rules = {
    'xs': {
        'layout': 'stacked',
        'panels': 'collapsed',
        'toolbars': 'compact'
    },
    'sm': {
        'layout': 'tabbed',
        'panels': 'minimal',
        'toolbars': 'standard'
    },
    'lg': {
        'layout': 'split',
        'panels': 'full',
        'toolbars': 'extended'
    }
}
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Strategies

### Layout Caching
```python
# Intelligent layout caching
1. Cache layout calculations for common sizes
2. Invalidate cache only when necessary
3. Use weak references for memory management
4. Background pre-calculation for common breakpoints
```

### Incremental Updates
```python
# Minimal layout recalculation
1. Track layout dependencies
2. Update only affected components
3. Batch layout operations
4. Defer non-critical updates
```

### Memory Optimization
```python
# Efficient memory usage
1. Lazy loading of responsive variants
2. Shared resources across layouts
3. Garbage collection optimization
4. Memory pooling for frequent operations
```
