## 🔄 **State Management Patterns**

### Transaction Patterns
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing operation execution
- **Isolation**: Prevent interference between concurrent operations
- **Consistency**: Maintain data integrity throughout operations
- **Durability**: Ensure operations persist after completion

### Undo/Redo Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate operations as reversible commands
- **Memento Pattern**: Save operation states for restoration
- **Observer Pattern**: Notify UI of history changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different undo strategies for different operations

### Performance Patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently accessed operation results
- **Lazy Loading**: Load operation data only when needed
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse operation objects to reduce memory allocation
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations for efficiency

### Persistence Patterns
- **Serialization**: Convert operation states to persistent format
- **Versioning**: Handle state format changes across versions
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups with recovery mechanisms
- **Migration**: Smooth transitions between state formats

## 🛡️ **Data Integrity & Safety**

### Data Validation
- Validate operation parameters before execution
- Check state consistency after operations
- Verify data integrity during persistence
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of operation failures
- Automatic recovery from corrupted states
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- Fallback mechanisms for critical failures

### Concurrency Safety
- Thread-safe operation execution
- Deadlock prevention and detection
- Race condition elimination
- Atomic state updates
