# Agent 4: PDF.js Advanced Features Integration
**Issue #16.4 | Sub-Issue #127 | Days 4-6 | Final Integration & User Experience**

## 🎯 Your Mission
You are **Agent 4**, responsible for implementing advanced PDF.js features and integrating with the main UI framework for seamless user experience. Your work delivers the complete, user-facing PDF viewer with search, annotations, print, and polished UI integration that makes TORE Matrix Labs production-ready.

## 📋 Your Specific Tasks

### Phase 1: Search Functionality
- Implement full-text search across PDF documents
- Create search UI with result highlighting and navigation
- Add search options (case-sensitive, whole words, regex)
- Implement search history and bookmarks
- Create next/previous result navigation

### Phase 2: Text Selection & Interaction  
- Enable text selection in PDF viewer with accurate boundaries
- Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Create context menu for text selections
- Add text extraction API for programmatic access
- Enable selection-based operations (highlight, annotate)

### Phase 3: Annotation System
- Render PDF annotations (text, image, shapes) accurately
- Implement annotation interaction (click, hover, show/hide)
- Create annotation overlay system with proper positioning
- Add annotation data extraction and metadata access
- Implement annotation visibility toggles

### Phase 4: Print & Export
- Implement print functionality with comprehensive options
- Add page range selection and print preview
- Create export to image functionality (PNG, JPEG)
- Add print quality settings and paper size options
- Implement batch export capabilities

### Phase 5: UI Framework Integration
- Complete integration with UI Framework (#11-15)
- Create responsive toolbar and controls
- Implement thumbnail navigation panel
- Add progress indicators and user feedback
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## 🎯 User Experience Targets
- **Search speed**: <2s for full document search
- **UI responsiveness**: <100ms for all user interactions  
- **Thumbnail loading**: <500ms for panel population
- **Print preparation**: <5s for large documents
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Agent 1 (Core Viewer)
```python
# Interface provided by Agent 1
viewer.enable_features(feature_set)

# Your implementation
class FeatureSet:
    search_enabled: bool = True
    annotations_enabled: bool = True
    print_enabled: bool = True
    text_selection_enabled: bool = True
```

### With Agent 2 (Bridge)
```python
# Receive feature events from JavaScript
bridge.feature_event.connect(self.handle_feature_event)

# Send feature commands to JavaScript
bridge.send_feature_command("search", "find_text", {"query": "search term"})
```

### With Agent 3 (Performance)
```python
# Monitor performance of features
performance_monitor.metrics_updated.connect(self.update_feature_performance)
```

### With UI Framework (#11-15)
```python
# Complete UI integration
from torematrix.ui.layouts import LayoutManager
from torematrix.ui.components import ReactiveWidget
from torematrix.ui.themes import ThemeManager

class PDFViewerWidget(ReactiveWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        self.pdf_viewer = PDFViewer()
        # Complete UI framework integration
```
