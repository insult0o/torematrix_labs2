# Agent Prompts for TORE Matrix Labs Issues

## 游린 Issue #47: Missing Visual Re-rendering of Image Areas After Page Change
**Agent:** PDF GUI rehydration agent (visual canvas sync logic)  
**Branch:** `fix/image-areas-visibility`

### Prompt:
You are a PDF GUI rehydration specialist working on TORE Matrix Labs. Your task is to fix issue #47 where image areas disappear from the PDF canvas when switching pages.

**Context:**
- Image areas are drawn as bounding boxes classified as "Image"
- They appear in the preview panel and area list but not on the PDF canvas after page changes
- The issue is specifically about visual rendering, not data persistence

**Your tasks:**
1. Checkout the branch `fix/image-areas-visibility`
2. Investigate the PDF viewer component in `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/pdf_viewer.py`
3. Look at the `manual_validation_widget.py` to understand how areas are drawn
4. Find where page change events are handled and where area redrawing should occur
5. Implement proper area re-rendering logic when returning to a page
6. Ensure the `handle_page_change` method properly triggers area redraw for Image type areas
7. Test with a PDF containing image areas, verifying they persist visually across page navigation
8. Create a test file `test_image_area_visibility_fix.py` to verify the fix

**Key files to examine:**
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/pdf_viewer.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/manual_validation_widget.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/enhanced_drag_select.py`

**Success criteria:**
- Image areas remain visible on the PDF canvas after page switching
- No regression in other area types
- Clear logging of area re-rendering process

4. Add proper error handling and validation for text selection
5. Implement graceful handling of invalid selections
6. Add defensive programming to prevent crashes
7. Test with various PDFs and text selection scenarios
8. Create a test file `test_text_highlight_crash_fix.py` to verify stability

**Key files to examine:**
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/highlighting/highlighting_engine.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/page_validation_widget.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/pdf_viewer.py`

**Success criteria:**
- No crashes when highlighting text
- Invalid selections handled gracefully with user feedback
- Text highlighting remains functional for valid selections

## 游린 Issue #49: Drawn Areas Not Persisting After Project Reload
**Agent:** Storage state management agent  
**Branch:** `fix/area-state-rehydration`

### Prompt:
You are a storage state management specialist working on TORE Matrix Labs. Your task is to fix issue #49 where drawn areas don't appear after project reload.

**Context:**
- Areas exist in metadata but aren't rendered after reopening a project
- This is a state persistence and rehydration issue
- The manual validation workflow is affected

**Your tasks:**
1. Checkout the branch `fix/area-state-rehydration`
2. Investigate project loading in `tore_matrix_labs/core/project.py`
3. Examine how areas are saved and loaded from `.tore` files
4. Check the `manual_validation_widget.py` for area loading logic
5. Ensure areas are properly restored and rendered on project load
6. Implement proper state rehydration for all area types
7. Test save/load cycle with multiple area types
8. Create a test file `test_area_persistence_fix.py` to verify the fix

**Key files to examine:**
- `tore_matrix_labs/core/project.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/manual_validation_widget.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/core/storage_handler.py`

**Success criteria:**
- All drawn areas appear correctly after project reload
- Area properties (type, position, metadata) are preserved
- No data loss during save/load cycle

## 游린 Issue #50: Image Areas Re-disappear After Being Recreated Post-Load
**Agent:** PDF viewer component memory agent  
**Branch:** `fix/redraw-image-state`

### Prompt:
You are a PDF viewer component memory specialist working on TORE Matrix Labs. Your task is to fix issue #50 where newly drawn areas disappear after page navigation in a reloaded project.

**Context:**
- After reloading a project, new areas drawn don't persist during page navigation
- This is a runtime state management issue
- Different from the initial load problem

**Your tasks:**
1. Checkout the branch `fix/redraw-image-state`
2. Investigate runtime area management in `enhanced_drag_select.py`
3. Check how areas are stored in memory during runtime
4. Ensure newly created areas are properly added to the runtime state
5. Fix the page navigation logic to preserve new areas
6. Implement proper state synchronization between components
7. Test with creating new areas after project load
8. Create a test file `test_runtime_area_persistence_fix.py`

**Key files to examine:**
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/enhanced_drag_select.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/ui/components/manual_validation_widget.py`
- `tore_matrix_labs/core/storage_handler.py`

**Success criteria:**
- Newly created areas persist during page navigation
- Runtime state properly synchronized
- No difference in behavior between fresh and reloaded projects
