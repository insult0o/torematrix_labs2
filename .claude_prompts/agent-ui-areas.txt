Repository: https://github.com/insult0o/tore-matrix-labs

**Problem**: Areas that were cut/selected in previous sessions are not being displayed in the document preview, even though they exist in the project data.

2. Check manual_validation_widget.py area display logic
3. Verify area storage and retrieval in area_storage_manager.py
4. Fix the highlighting/display synchronization
5. Test with projects "4.tore" and "7.tore"

**Working Branch**: issue-3-agent-ui-areas

**Focus Areas**:
- Manual validation widget area list display
- PDF viewer area highlighting
- Area storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Highlighting engine integration

Please start by examining the current state and identifying why areas aren't displaying properly.
