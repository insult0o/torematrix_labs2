# TORE Matrix Labs V3

## 🚀 Next-Generation Document Processing Platform

TORE Matrix Labs V3 is a complete ground-up rewrite of the document processing platform, leveraging all lessons learned from V1 and V2 to create a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Unified Element Model**: Single data model supporting 15+ element types from unstructured library
- **Modern Architecture**: Event-driven, modular design with clean abstractions
- **Enterprise Ready**: Multi-backend storage, performance optimized for 10K+ elements
- **Professional UI**: PyQt6-based interface with responsive design
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: Document ingestion → Manual validation → Processing → QA → Export
