## ðŸ“‹ Coordination Notes for All Agents

### Shared Resources
- **Main Window**: Dependency for layout container integration (Issue #11)
- **Reactive Components**: Dependency for layout items (Issue #12)
- **Configuration Management**: Already complete (Issue #5)

### Communication Protocol
- Daily sync at coordination checkpoints
- Clear handoff documentation on Day 3
- Agent 4 coordinates final integration on Day 4

### Layout Templates to Implement
```
Document Layout: Main viewer + properties + corrections panels
Split Layout: Primary and secondary content areas  
Tabbed Layout: Tab-based content organization
Multi-Panel: Complex workflow with multiple panels
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
```
XS (â‰¤576px): Mobile portrait - stacked layout
SM (â‰¤768px): Mobile landscape - tabbed layout
MD (â‰¤992px): Tablet - simplified split layout  
LG (â‰¤1200px): Desktop - full split layout
XL (â‰¥1201px): Large desktop - extended layout
```

### Success Criteria
- >95% test coverage for each agent's components
- All agents ready for integration by Day 3
- Complete system integration by Day 4
- Responsive design working across all screen sizes
- 60fps smooth transition animations
- Production readiness by Day 6
