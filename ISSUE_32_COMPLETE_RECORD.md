3. **JSONL**: Standard fine-tuning format
4. **ChatML**: OpenAI conversation format
5. **Alpaca**: Instruction-following format
6. **ShareGPT**: Multi-turn conversation format

### Tokenization Support
- OpenAI (tiktoken)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- HuggingFace (transformers)
- Google (sentencepiece)
- Custom tokenizers

### Optimization Features
- Smart chunking with context preservation
- Overlap handling for continuity
- Multi-level deduplication
- Quality scoring algorithms
- Dataset statistics and analytics

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Deploy Agent 1 (NOW):
```bash
"I need you to work on Issue #273 - Core Export Engine & Text Processing. This is Agent 1's task for the fine-tuning text exporter system.

Key objectives:
1. Implement base export infrastructure
2. Create text processing engine
3. Build basic export formats
4. Set up testing framework

Use the specifications in AGENT_1_EXPORT.md and create branch: feature/export-engine-agent1-issue32.1"
```

### Sequential Deployment:
- Agent 2: After Agent 1 completes core engine
- Agent 3: After Agents 1-2 complete infrastructure
- Agent 4: After all agents complete their components

## 📊 Project Impact
- Enables high-quality fine-tuning dataset generation
- Supports multiple LLM training formats
- Optimizes token usage and costs
- Provides enterprise-grade export capabilities
- Integrates seamlessly with document pipeline
