Issue: "bug_multiple_docs_loaded" - Duplicate documents appearing in projects

Repository: https://github.com/insult0o/tore-matrix-labs
Issue URL: https://github.com/insult0o/tore-matrix-labs/issues/2

**Problem**: When reprocessing documents inside a saved project, after restarting session and reopening the project, duplicate documents appear in the project document list. The more you process/save/reopen, the more duplicates appear.

**Your Task**:
1. Investigate document loading and storage logic
2. Find where duplicate documents are being added
3. Fix the project state management to prevent duplicates
4. Ensure proper cleanup when reprocessing
5. Test with existing projects to verify fix

**Working Branch**: issue-2-agent-project-docs

**Focus Areas**:
- Project loading logic in main_window.py
- Document list management in project_manager_widget.py
- Document processor state handling
- Project model data integrity

Please start by examining how documents are loaded and stored in projects to identify the duplication source.
