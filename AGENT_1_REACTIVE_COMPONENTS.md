# AGENT 1: Core Reactive Base Classes - Reactive Components System

## 🎯 Mission
Implement the core reactive base classes and fundamental mechanisms for reactive UI components in the TORE Matrix Labs V3 platform.

## 📋 Sub-Issue Assignment
**GitHub Issue**: #108 - [Reactive Components] Sub-Issue #12.1: Core Reactive Base Classes
**Agent Role**: Core/Foundation
**Timeline**: Day 1-3 of 6-day cycle

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Create ReactiveWidget base class for PyQt6
2. Implement metaclass for reactive behavior
3. Design basic property binding system
4. Establish core lifecycle management
5. Define foundation patterns for component composition

## 🏗️ Architecture Responsibilities

### Core Components
- **ReactiveWidget Base Class**: Foundation for all reactive UI components
- **Reactive Metaclass**: Automatic reactive behavior injection
- **Property Binding System**: Type-safe reactive properties
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Mount/unmount/update management
- **Composition Patterns**: Component hierarchy and composition

## 🔗 Dependencies
- **Event Bus (#1)**: ✅ COMPLETE - For component communication
- **State Management (#3)**: ✅ COMPLETE - For state subscription patterns

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Day 1: Core Foundation
1. **ReactiveWidget Base Class**
   - Inherit from PyQt6.QtWidgets.QWidget
   - Implement basic reactive infrastructure
   - Add component identification and tracking
   - Establish property change detection

2. **Reactive Metaclass**
   - Create metaclass for automatic reactive behavior
   - Property registration and tracking
   - Automatic method binding for lifecycle hooks
   - Type hint processing for reactive properties

### Day 2: Property System & Lifecycle
1. **Property Binding System**
   - `@reactive_property` decorator
   - Type-safe property definitions
   - Change notification mechanisms
   - Computed property support

2. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Component mount/unmount hooks
   - Update lifecycle methods
   - Cleanup mechanisms
   - Error handling in lifecycle

### Day 3: Composition & Testing
1. **Component Composition**
   - Parent-child component relationships
   - Prop passing mechanisms
   - Component tree management
   - Communication patterns

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all core functionality
   - Property binding tests
   - Lifecycle hook tests
   - Error handling tests

## 📋 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] ReactiveWidget base class with full reactive infrastructure
- [ ] Reactive metaclass for automatic behavior injection
- [ ] Property binding decorators with type safety
- [ ] Lifecycle hook system (mount/unmount/update)
- [ ] Component composition patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests (>95% coverage)
- [ ] API documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for core operations

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- **PyQt6 Compatibility**: Full integration with PyQt6 widget system
- **Type Safety**: Complete type hints throughout
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for reactive behavior
- **Thread Safety**: Safe for Qt's threading model
- **Memory Efficiency**: No memory leaks or circular references
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes

## 🏗️ Integration Points

### With Agent 2 (State Subscription)
- Provide hooks for state subscription attachment
- Define interfaces for memory management
- Establish cleanup protocols

### With Agent 3 (Performance Optimization)
- Design interfaces for render optimization
- Provide hooks for performance monitoring
- Enable diffing and batching integration

### With Agent 4 (Integration & Error Handling)
- Define error boundary interfaces
- Provide async operation hooks
- Establish testing integration points

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] All reactive widgets properly inherit from ReactiveWidget
- [ ] Property changes trigger appropriate updates
- [ ] Lifecycle hooks execute in correct order
- [ ] No memory leaks in component creation/destruction
- [ ] >95% test coverage
- [ ] Zero performance regression from base Qt widgets

## 📚 API Design Principles
- **Simple**: Easy to use for common cases
- **Powerful**: Extensible for complex scenarios
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript-like type safety
- **Performant**: Minimal runtime overhead
- **Debuggable**: Clear error messages and debugging support

## 🎯 Day 3 Integration Readiness
By end of Day 3, provide:
