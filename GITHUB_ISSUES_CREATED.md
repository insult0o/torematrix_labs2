## Milestone Details

- **Milestone**: V3.0.0 Beta
- **Description**: PDF-to-LLM Pipeline Enhancements
- **Total Issues**: 50 (40 existing + 10 new)

## Labels Created

- `document-processing` - For document parsing and processing features
- `backend` - For backend infrastructure components
- `testing` - For testing and QA related issues
- `infrastructure` - For core infrastructure improvements

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize issues based on dependencies
2. Create detailed implementation plans for each issue
3. Set up project boards for tracking progress
4. Begin implementation starting with foundational components

## Issue Dependencies

- #41 (Multi-Library Parser) is foundational for most other processing issues
- #44 (Layout Analysis) enhances #47 (Intelligent Chunking)
- #48 (Caching) supports all document processing components
- #49 (QA Framework) tests all parsing components

All issues are properly labeled, assigned to the V3.0.0 Beta milestone, and include comprehensive technical requirements with code examples and acceptance criteria.
