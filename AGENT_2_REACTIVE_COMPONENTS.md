   - Debug tools for memory analysis

### Day 3: Cleanup & Optimization
1. **Cleanup Strategies**
   - Automatic cleanup on component destruction
   - Subscription cleanup protocols
   - Resource deallocation patterns
   - Error recovery cleanup

2. **Change Propagation Batching**

- [ ] Automatic cleanup mechanisms for components
- [ ] Memory leak detection and monitoring tools
- [ ] State change batching system for performance
- [ ] Comprehensive memory tests and benchmarks
- [ ] Memory profiling utilities
- [ ] Documentation for memory best practices

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- **Weak References**: Prevent circular dependencies and memory leaks
- **Thread Safety**: Safe subscription management across threads
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for subscription operations
- **Reliability**: Robust cleanup even in error conditions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking
- **Debugging**: Clear tools for diagnosing memory issues

## 🏗️ Integration Points

### With Agent 1 (Core Reactive Base)
- Integrate with ReactiveWidget lifecycle hooks
- Use reactive property system for state binding
- Leverage component composition patterns

### With Agent 3 (Performance Optimization)
- Coordinate with render batching system
- Optimize subscription change propagation
- Share performance monitoring infrastructure

### With Agent 4 (Integration & Error Handling)
- Provide cleanup hooks for error boundaries
- Support async operation state management
- Integrate with testing utilities

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in component lifecycle tests
- [ ] Automatic subscription cleanup on component destruction
- [ ] <10ms latency for state change propagation
- [ ] >95% test coverage for memory management
- [ ] Successful handling of 1000+ concurrent subscriptions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over long sessions

## 🛡️ Memory Safety Patterns

### Subscription Lifecycle
```python
# Automatic subscription on component mount
component.mount() -> auto-subscribe to relevant state
component.update() -> receive batched state changes
component.unmount() -> auto-cleanup all subscriptions
```

### Weak Reference Management
```python
# Parent-child relationships use weak references
parent.add_child(child)  # Uses WeakRef internally
child destroyed -> automatically removed from parent
```

### Cleanup Protocols
```python
# Multi-level cleanup strategy
1. Component-level cleanup (subscriptions, events)
2. Memory-level cleanup (weak refs, circular refs)
3. System-level cleanup (batching, monitoring)
```

## 🔍 Memory Monitoring Tools
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Component lifecycle visualization
- Subscription dependency graphs
- Memory leak detection alerts
- Performance impact analysis

## 🎯 Day 3 Integration Readiness
By end of Day 3, provide:
- Fully functional state subscription system
- Comprehensive memory management utilities
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms
- Ready for Agent 3 performance integration
- Ready for Agent 4 error handling integration
- Memory-safe foundation for all reactive components
