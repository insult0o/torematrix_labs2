# CLAUDE.md - Context File

## Current Work Status
- Working on new page-by-page corrections interface design
- Replacing problematic coordinate-based highlighting with side-by-side approach
- Creating new PageValidationWidget for better accuracy and user experience
- Focus on project file "4.tore" and "7.tore"

## Recent Tasks Completed
- Created test files for corrections logic
- Implemented vertical layout testing
- Working on improved corrections display
- Fixed corrections display issues:
  - Doubled vertical size of text boxes in corrections display (minimum 200px height)
  - Fixed error highlighting in extraction edition field (improved visibility with yellow background, red text, bold formatting)
  - Fixed error correlation between extraction and PDF display sections (improved coordinate conversion, page navigation)
  - Enhanced PDF highlighting with better visibility and automatic page navigation
- Fixed config file JSON parsing error (completed malformed config.json)
- Made OCR recognition text field bigger vertically (120px minimum height, editable text area)
- Implemented precise highlighting for exact error location in extraction text:
  - Multiple search strategies (exact match, cleaned text, character-level)
  - Bright yellow highlighting with red text and underline
  - Fuzzy matching for difficult-to-find errors
  - Automatic cursor positioning for visibility
- Implemented precise highlighting for exact error location in PDF:
  - Character-level text search using PyMuPDF
  - Automatic page navigation to error location
  - Multiple search strategies for problematic OCR characters
  - Enhanced coordinate conversion and bounds checking
  - Improved visibility with thicker borders and better colors
- Fixed QStandardPaths runtime directory permissions warning:
  - Added automatic runtime directory permissions fix on application startup
  - Handles WSL2 permission issues where /run/user/1000 has 755 instead of 700
  - Logs permission fixes for debugging
  - Prevents Qt warning about incorrect directory permissions

## Next Steps - Page-by-Page Interface Implementation
Current progress: âœ… **COMPLETED** - New PageValidationWidget implemented and integrated

**Completed tasks:**
1. âœ… Create new page-by-page validation widget file (page_validation_widget.py)
2. âœ… Add basic layout structure with splitter
3. âœ… Add page navigation controls  
4. âœ… Create extracted text display area
5. âœ… Add issue navigation buttons
6. âœ… Implement error data processing and navigation
7. âœ… Add issue information display
8. âœ… Add PDF highlighting synchronization
9. âœ… Integrate with main window (replaced QAValidationWidget)

**Key Improvements Made:**
- âœ… **Fixed widget display**: New PageValidationWidget now shows instead of old QA widget
- âœ… **Enhanced error location precision**: Leverages both bbox coordinates and text_position from .tore files
- âœ… **Better navigation**: Page-by-page and issue-by-issue navigation with clear labeling
- âœ… **Rich error context**: Shows error type, description, severity with color coding
- âœ… **Side-by-side layout**: PDF viewer + extracted text with synchronized highlighting
- âœ… **Data structure analysis**: Researched .tore file format showing comprehensive error location data
- âœ… **Text highlighting**: Implemented precise text highlighting using text_position coordinates
- âœ… **Multiple search strategies**: Fallback text search when coordinates are invalid
- âœ… **Smart navigation**: Automatic text loading and highlighting on page/issue changes
- âœ… **Professional UI**: Color-coded severity levels, responsive layout, clear information display

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Error data structure**: bbox coordinates + text_position + page + severity + type
- **Navigation logic**: Efficient page grouping and issue indexing for 184+ corrections
- **Highlighting strategy**: Primary text_position, fallback to text search, visual feedback
- **Signal compatibility**: Maintains highlight_pdf_location signal for PDF synchronization
- **Error types supported**: OCR errors, formatting issues, table problems, encoding errors

**New Design Approach (COMPLETED):**
âœ… Side-by-side: PDF viewer (left) + extracted text (right)  
âœ… Page-by-page navigation instead of issue list  
âœ… Multiple issue colors per page (severity-based color coding)  
âœ… Precise positioning between issues (automatic text cursor positioning)  
âœ… Better coordinate matching (dual strategy: text_position + bbox coordinates)

**Result Summary:**
The new PageValidationWidget successfully replaces the problematic coordinate-based highlighting system with a more accurate and user-friendly approach. It now handles 184+ corrections across 54 pages with:

**âœ… COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS:**
- **Removed PDF viewer widget** - Uses document preview instead for better integration
- **Full-width extracted content** - Same size as document preview for consistent experience
- **Real-time page text extraction** - Shows all text from current page using PyMuPDF
- **Multi-strategy highlighting** - Text position â†’ text search â†’ bbox approximation
- **Severity-based color coding** - Critical (red), Major (yellow), Medium (orange), Minor (green)
- **Synchronized navigation** - Both document preview and extracted content jump to exact issue locations
- **Log widget integration** - Issue explanations and navigation details appear in log section
- **Professional interface** - Clean layout with clear navigation controls and issue information

**âœ… LATEST ENHANCEMENTS:**
- **Precise coordinate mapping** - Character-level mapping between text positions and PDF coordinates
- **Cursor synchronization** - Text cursor position automatically shows corresponding PDF location
- **Text selection highlighting** - Selected text in extracted content highlights in PDF viewer
- **All issues visible** - All page issues highlighted simultaneously with active issue distinct
- **Correction workflow** - Approve/reject buttons with status tracking and save functionality
- **Editable text content** - Users can make corrections directly in the text area
- **Smart highlighting** - Active issue in bright orange, inactive issues in subtle colors
- **Status management** - Track approved/rejected corrections with visual feedback

**ðŸ”§ DEBUGGING & FIXES:**
- **PDF highlighting fixed** - Corrected coordinate validation and bbox handling in PDF viewer
- **Text position accuracy** - Using PyMuPDF word extraction for precise character-to-coordinate mapping  
- **Multi-strategy highlighting** - Text position â†’ search fallback â†’ bbox-only for robust highlighting
- **Debug logging added** - Comprehensive logging for coordinate conversion and highlighting process
- **Navigation improvements** - Fixed page navigation and highlighting refresh on issue changes
- **Coordinate system fixed** - Proper PDF-to-pixmap coordinate conversion with Y-axis flipping
- **Error data validation** - Coordinates from .tore files verified as accurate and within page bounds

**ðŸ”§ LATEST FIXES:**
- **Text formatting restored** - Using standard get_text() method to preserve original PDF formatting and spacing
- **Mouse interaction fixed** - Added proper mouse event handling for text selection and cursor positioning
- **Coordinate mapping improved** - Character-level mapping with fallback strategy for missing positions
- **Selection highlighting added** - Mouse drag selection automatically highlights corresponding PDF areas
- **PDF viewer methods added** - Added highlight_selection() and show_cursor_location() methods
- **Debug mapping validation** - Added mapping coverage statistics and sample position logging
- **Performance optimized** - Reduced log spam and improved coordinate lookup efficiency
