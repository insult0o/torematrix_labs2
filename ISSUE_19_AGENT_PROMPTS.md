1. Create base selection tool architecture
2. Implement abstract base classes and interfaces
3. Create tool state management system
4. Implement core selection geometry algorithms
5. Create cursor management and event handling
6. Establish tool registration system

I need to create the foundation that all other agents will build upon. This includes:
