## 🔧 Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. **PyQt6 Import Dependencies**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Affects accessibility features and some GUI components  
**Resolution**: Review PyQt6 version compatibility and import statements

### 2. **Metaclass Conflicts**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: BasePropertyEditor inheritance issues  
**Resolution**: Refactor class hierarchy to resolve metaclass conflicts

### 3. **Core Model Dependencies**
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Some import chains have missing dependencies  
**Resolution**: Ensure all core models are properly implemented

### 4. **Test Environment Limitations**
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Cannot run full GUI tests in current environment  
**Resolution**: Set up proper Qt testing environment for comprehensive validation

## 📋 Recommendations
