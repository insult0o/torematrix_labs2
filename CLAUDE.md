# CLAUDE.md - TORE Matrix Labs V3 Context

## üöÄ Project Overview
TORE Matrix Labs V3 is a complete greenfield rewrite of the document processing platform. Starting from scratch with all lessons learned from V1 analysis.

## üéØ Key Design Principles
1. **Clean Architecture** - No legacy constraints
2. **Unified Data Model** - Single element model for all types
3. **Event-Driven** - Modern async architecture
4. **Performance First** - Optimized for 10K+ elements
5. **Test-Driven** - Comprehensive testing from day 1

## üìã Core Requirements (From V1 Analysis)
- Support 15+ element types from unstructured library
- Manual validation workflow with area selection
- Page-by-page corrections interface
- Quality assessment and approval workflow
- Multi-format export (JSON, XML, CSV, PDF, HTML, DOCX)
- Project persistence with .tore format compatibility
- Enterprise-ready with multi-backend storage

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow - Standard Operating Procedure

### Trigger: "Let's work on issue X"
When this command is given, I will automatically execute the following comprehensive workflow:

### üìã Workflow Steps:
1. **Analyze Parent Issue** - Understand requirements and identify 4 parallelizable components
2. **Create 4 Sub-Issues** - One for each agent with format: `[Parent Topic] Sub-Issue #X.Y: [Component]`
3. **Create 4 Agent Instruction Files**:
   - `AGENT_1_[TOPIC].md` - Core/Foundation (no dependencies)
   - `AGENT_2_[TOPIC].md` - Data/Persistence (depends on Agent 1)
   - `AGENT_3_[TOPIC].md` - Performance/Optimization (depends on Agent 1)
   - `AGENT_4_[TOPIC].md` - Integration/Polish (depends on all)
4. **Create Coordination Guide** - `[TOPIC]_COORDINATION.md` with timeline and integration points
5. **Update All GitHub Issues** - Parent and sub-issues with implementation details

### üìÅ Agent Instruction File Structure:
- Your Assignment & Specific Tasks
- Files to Create (with tree structure)
- Technical Implementation Details (with code examples)
- Testing Requirements (>95% coverage)
- Integration Points
- GitHub Workflow
- Success Criteria
- Communication Protocol

### ‚è±Ô∏è Standard Timeline:
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-2)**: Foundation building
- **Phase 2 (Days 3-4)**: Integration work
- **Phase 3 (Days 5-6)**: Testing and polish

### üìä Standard Success Metrics:
- Test coverage >95%
- Performance targets defined and met
- Full API documentation
- Integration tests passing
- Type coverage 100%

### üîÑ This workflow ensures:
- Consistent parallel development
- Clear dependencies and integration points
- Daily progress tracking via GitHub
- High-quality deliverables
- Efficient 6-day development cycles
- **MANDATORY PR workflow for ALL agents without exception**

## üèÅ Agent "End Work" Routine - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

### Trigger: "end work"
When the user says "end work", execute this standardized completion routine:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ALL AGENTS (1, 2, 3, 4) MUST follow this exact workflow without exception. Any agent work that bypasses the PR creation and issue closure process is inconsistent with project standards and must be corrected.**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run All Tests
```bash
# Run tests for your specific component
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/unit/core/[your-component]/ -v

# Verify all tests pass before proceeding
# If any fail, fix them first
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stage and Commit Changes - REQUIRED FOR ALL AGENTS
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with standardized message format - MUST include sub-issue number
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Update Issue Task Lists
```bash
# **CRITICAL**: Update both parent issue and sub-issue task lists to reflect completion
# This step is essential for proper project tracking and documentation

# Update the sub-issue to tick off completed implementation tasks
gh issue edit [sub-issue-number] --body "$(gh issue view [sub-issue-number] --json body -q .body | sed 's/- \[ \]/- [x]/g')"

# Update the parent issue to tick off completed acceptance criteria  
gh issue edit [parent-issue-number] --body "$(gh issue view [parent-issue-number] --json body -q .body | sed 's/- \[ \]/- [x]/g')"

# Add completion comment to parent issue if needed
gh issue comment [parent-issue-number] --body "üìã Updated task lists to reflect Agent [X] completion of Sub-Issue #[sub-issue-number]"
```

### üìù Important Notes - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL AGENTS:
- **CRITICAL**: Always complete steps 5 & 6 - cross-check tasks and close sub-issue
- **MANDATORY**: In step 5, FIRST tick ALL checkboxes in the issue body, THEN add checklist comment
- **REQUIRED**: EVERY SINGLE TASK checkbox [ ] MUST become [x] after implementation
- **REQUIRED**: EVERY SINGLE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA checkbox [ ] MUST become [x] after testing
- **VERIFICATION**: All tests must pass BEFORE ticking acceptance criteria
- Replace all placeholders in square brackets `[...]` with actual values
- Ensure all tests pass before proceeding
- Include specific metrics and achievements
- Reference the correct issue numbers
- Use consistent formatting across all agents
- **Never skip the final cross-check and closure steps**
- **NO AGENT WORK IS COMPLETE until ALL checkboxes are visually ticked in GitHub issue**
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Any unticked boxes indicate incomplete work**

### üéØ This routine ensures:
- **Complete task verification** with cross-checking
- **Proper sub-issue closure** with full documentation
- Consistent completion reporting
- Proper GitHub workflow
- Clear communication to other agents
- Professional documentation
- Traceability of all work done

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORKFLOW CONSISTENCY ENFORCEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Critical Issue Identified and Resolved:
**Previous agents may have bypassed the mandatory PR workflow.** This creates inconsistency and must be prevented:

### ‚ùå **INCORRECT Workflow (What NOT to do):**
- Direct commits to main/feature branches without PR
- Closing issues without proper documentation
- Skipping the "end work" routine
- Not creating pull requests for agent work
- Missing issue cross-referencing

### ‚úÖ **CORRECT Workflow (MANDATORY for ALL agents):**
1. **Feature Branch**: Always work on feature/[component-name] branch
2. **Commit**: Use standardized commit format with issue reference
3. **Push**: Push feature branch to origin
4. **Pull Request**: ALWAYS create PR with comprehensive description
5. **Issue Updates**: Comment on parent issue with progress
6. **Cross-Check**: Verify all tasks completed in sub-issue
7. **Close Issue**: Close sub-issue with full completion summary

### üîí **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **NO agent work is considered complete without a merged PR**
- **ALL sub-issues MUST be closed through the standardized process**
- **EVERY TASK checkbox [ ] MUST be ticked [x] after implementation**
- **EVERY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA checkbox [ ] MUST be ticked [x] after testing verification**
- **NO agent work is complete until ALL checkboxes are visually ticked in GitHub**
- **ANY deviation from this workflow is non-compliant and must be corrected**
- **Future agents MUST follow this process without exception**
- **Unticked checkboxes indicate incomplete work and non-compliance**

### üìù **For Project Maintainers:**
If you find agent work that bypassed this workflow:
1. Identify the missing PR for the sub-issue
2. Ensure the sub-issue is properly closed
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are documented
4. Update this documentation if needed
