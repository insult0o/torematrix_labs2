## ⚡ Performance Optimization Strategies

### Diffing Optimization
```python
# Smart diffing with minimal operations
1. Compare virtual representations first
2. Generate minimal change set
3. Apply only necessary DOM updates
4. Cache diff results for repeated patterns
```

### Render Batching
```python
# Frame-based batching system
1. Collect all changes during frame
2. Prioritize critical updates
3. Batch non-critical updates
4. Execute in single render pass
```

### Component Memoization
```python
# Intelligent component caching
1. Cache render results based on props/state
2. Skip rendering if inputs unchanged
3. Invalidate cache on relevant changes
4. Memory-efficient cache management
```
