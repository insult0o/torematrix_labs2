# Issue #8 Breakdown Complete - Processing Pipeline Architecture

## Summary

Successfully broke down Issue #8 (Processing Pipeline Architecture) into 4 parallelizable sub-issues for agent-based development.

## Created Sub-Issues

1. **Issue #88**: Core Pipeline Manager & DAG Architecture (Agent 1)
   - DAG-based pipeline orchestration
   - Stage management and execution
   - State persistence and checkpointing

2. **Issue #90**: Processor Plugin System & Interface (Agent 2)
   - Flexible processor plugin architecture
   - Standardized processor interface
   - Dynamic loading and registration

3. **Issue #91**: Worker Pool & Progress Tracking (Agent 3)
   - Multi-type worker pool (async/thread/process)
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Resource monitoring and management

4. **Issue #92**: Integration, Monitoring & Testing (Agent 4)
   - System integration and coordination
   - Prometheus-based monitoring
   - Comprehensive testing framework

## Created Documentation

1. **Agent Instructions**:
   - `/home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/torematrix_storage/AGENT_1_PIPELINE.md`
   - `/home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/torematrix_storage/AGENT_2_PIPELINE.md`
   - `/home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/torematrix_storage/AGENT_3_PIPELINE.md`
   - `/home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/torematrix_storage/AGENT_4_PIPELINE.md`

2. **Coordination Guide**:
   - `/home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/torematrix_storage/PIPELINE_COORDINATION.md`

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Architecture**: Event-driven with clear component separation
2. **Execution Model**: DAG-based with parallel stage execution
3. **Worker Types**: Async (I/O), Thread (CPU-light), Process (CPU-heavy)
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with real-time progress events
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based processor system

## Success Metrics

- Process 100+ documents concurrently
- < 30 second average processing time
- Support 15+ document formats via plugins
- 99.9% reliability with automatic retries
- Horizontal scaling capability

## Next Steps

1. Agents 1-3 can begin parallel development immediately
2. Agent 4 prepares integration framework and waits for components
3. All agents follow test-driven development approach
4. Regular sync on shared interfaces via coordination guide
