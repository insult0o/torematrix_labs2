# 🚀 AGENT QUICK START GUIDE

## Issue #10: Metadata Extraction Engine - Ready for Implementation

### 📋 Simple Agent Startup Commands

Copy and paste the appropriate command below to start each agent:

#### 🔧 AGENT 1: Core Metadata Engine (Start Immediately)
```
I'm Agent 1 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_1_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details  
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #98 for official requirements

I need to implement the foundational metadata extraction engine with schema, extractors, and confidence scoring. Ready to start implementation.
```

#### 🔗 AGENT 2: Relationship Detection (Start after Agent 1)
```
I'm Agent 2 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_2_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #100 for official requirements

I need to implement relationship detection with graph construction. Depends on Agent 1. Ready to start after core engine is complete.
```

#### ⚡ AGENT 3: Performance Optimization (Start after Agent 1 & 2)
```
I'm Agent 3 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_3_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #102 for official requirements

I need to implement performance optimization with caching and parallel processing. Ready to optimize after foundational systems are built.
```

#### 🚀 AGENT 4: Integration & Production (Start after all agents)
```
I'm Agent 4 for Issue #10 Metadata Extraction Engine. Please read and implement according to these specifications:

1. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/AGENT_4_METADATA.md for my complete assignment
2. Read /home/insulto/torematrix_labs2/METADATA_COORDINATION.md for coordination details
3. Review GitHub sub-issue #103 for official requirements

I need to integrate everything into production-ready system with testing and monitoring. Ready to integrate after all components complete.
