## üß† MEMORY UPDATE FOR ALL CLAUDE INSTANCES

### üèÅ COMPLETE AGENT END WORK ROUTINE (6 STEPS - MANDATORY)

When user says 'end work', ALWAYS execute ALL 6 steps:

1. **Run All Tests** - Verify everything passes
2. **Stage and Commit Changes** - With proper commit messages
3. **Push and Create Pull Request** - Detailed PR description  
4. **Update Main Issue** - Comment on parent issue
5. **Cross-Check Implementation Tasks** - ‚òëÔ∏è Verify ALL tasks done, ALL acceptance criteria met, ALL tests passing
6. **Close Sub-Issue** - Official closure with final summary

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: 
- **NEVER skip steps 5 & 6** - These are mandatory for proper completion
- Step 5: Must cross-check ALL implementation tasks and acceptance criteria
- Step 6: Must officially close the sub-issue with final summary
- Without steps 5 & 6, the work is INCOMPLETE

### üìç This routine is now saved in:
- CLAUDE.md file in torematrix_labs2 project
- Available for all future Claude instances
- Committed to git for persistence

**REMEMBER: Complete 6-step routine or work is not finished\!**
